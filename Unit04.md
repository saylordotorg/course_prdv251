**Unit 4: Organizing Content and Information for More Complex Websites
using HTML and CSS** <span id="4"></span> 
*Now that we have a strong foundation for creating simple single-page
websites, we will learn how to develop websites with several parts
accessed through a menu.  This unit will address contemporary
best-practices for creating sophisticated websites, new technologies on
the horizon, and a deprecated technique that you may find in some legacy
code. *

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take approximately 6 hours to complete.  
  
 ☐    Unit 4 Introductory Video: 0.1 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.1: 0.3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.2: 0.4 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.3: 3.5 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.4: 1.6 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 4.5: 0.1 hours

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
-   Identify deprecated uses of frames in existing HTML code.
-   Use \<div\> tags in an HTML file with associated CSS instructions to
    organize information and content in syntactically and stylistically
    correct HTML4.
-   Use newer HTML5 tags with associated CSS instructions to organize
    information and content. 

**4.1 HTML’s ?div? and ?span? Tags** <span id="4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Evan Goer’s Pocket HTML Tutorial: “Div and Span”**
    Link: Evan Goer’s *Pocket HTML Tutorial*: [“Div and
    Span”](http://www.goer.org/HTML/intermediate/div_and_span/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: The ?div? and ?span? tags are crucial to contemporary
    site design.  With “id” and “class” attributes, they allow the coder
    to specify different presentational qualities for the different
    parts of the Website.  For instance, it is common to have a ?div?
    for the banner, a ?div? for the body, a ?div? for side-navigation,
    and a ?div? for the footer.  Since you can specify different
    background, color, and font characteristics for each id using CSS
    selectors, it is easy to create familiar webpage layouts using these
    tools.

    sophisticated modern websites.  Fortunately, with the skills you
    have already developed for manipulating the presentation of HTML
    lists using CSS, you are able to create a variety of navigation bar
    styles.

**4.3 Styling HTML ?div? Tags to Create Familiar Multi-Column Layouts**
<span id="4.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Multi-Column Layouts for the
    HTML4 and CSS Beginner”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“Multi-Column Layouts for the HTML4
    and CSS
    Beginner”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PRDV251-OC-4.3multi-columnlayout-FINAL.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This tutorial demonstrates how to use the ?div? tag
    with CSS to create a familiar multi-column layout.  You will use
    this tutorial to convert your simple example webpage into a
    sophisticated 3-column layout.  Please use the HTML and CSS files
    attached here as examples while you work through the reading.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 30 minutes.

-   **Reading: Wikiversity’s Web Design: “CSS Challenge 3” and “CSS
    Challenge 4”**
    Link: Wikiversity’s *Web Design*: [“CSS Challenge
    3”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_Wikiversity_CSS-Challenge-3-2-column-layout-12.7.12.pdf) (PDF)
    and [“CSS Challenge

     Instructions: These CSS Challenges provide example HTML code
    prepared for the common 2-column layouts found throughout the Web
    today.  They challenge you to produce CSS code that formats them. 
    In a sense, this is the culmination of all the skills you have
    learned so far, so return to this challenge frequently to test your
    skills.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Creating Multi-Column Layouts
    using HTML and CSS”**
    Instructions: The examples provided in this sub-unit and the skills
    you have developed by working with the CSS Challenges from
    Wikiversity, now try to apply a 2-column or 3-column layout to your
    example website.  This will entail editing both your HTML and your
    CSS.  You might consider reusing some of the CSS code you developed
    for the CSS Challenges for this assignment – remember that
    modularity and reusability are two of the merits of abstracting
    presentational markup from semantic markup.  Refer back to the CSS
    Zen Gardenand the code examples from the Google Code University for
    ideas.  Work towards making an aesthetically pleasing and usable
    website from the materials you have already developed.  At this
    point, you have enough background information to hunt online
    resources for ideas, code snippets, and tutorials to help your
    realize virtually any design you can imagine.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 2 hours.

**4.4 New Tags in HTML5 Increase Semantic Specificity** <span
id="4.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Mark Pilgrim’s Dive Into HTML5: “Semantics”**
    Link: Mark Pilgrim’s *Dive Into HTML5*:
     [“Semantics”](http://diveintohtml5.info/semantics.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: You will remember that the role of HTML is to store
    semantic content, while the role of CSS is to abstract
    presentational information from this content.  But, as you have
    probably observed, the ?div? tag does not tell us much about the
    content that it encapsulates and only provides semantic information
    about this content through the use of ids or classes.  Since this is
    somewhat against the spirit of abstracting presentational
    information from semantic content, the new HTML5 standard introduces
    some extra tags allow more semantically specific markup, often
    replacing the heavy reliance on the ?div? tag in the older HTML4
    standard.  This optional chapter addresses these new tags.  Most
    readers can skim up to the heading “New Semantic Elements in HTML5,”
    but before using these new tags, it would be worth your time to read
    up on compatibility issues in HTML5 – which are addressed throughout
    Mark Pilgrim’s book.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 1 hour.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Creating Multi-Column Layouts
    using HTML5 and CSS”**
    Instructions: Drawing on the multi-column layout you created using
    ?div? tags and the HTML4 standard, try to “port” this website to the
    HTML5 standard using the information in Pilgrim’s chapter.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**4.5 A Deprecated Technique for Organizing HTML Content: Frames** <span

     Instructions: This is an optional, supplementary reading that
    provides some extra information about an old technique for dividing
    content on webpages.  This technique will not work with some modern
    browsers, is incompatible with the HTML4 standard, and should
    generally be avoided.  Even so, if you are working on an older
    website or looking a code from a legacy site for educational
    purposes, you may discover this once-common technique.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

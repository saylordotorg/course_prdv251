**Unit 2: First Steps in HTML and CSS Coding** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the second unit, we will begin to learn the syntax rules that enable
us to read and write HTML and CSS files.  This unit is divided into two
subunits.  The first subunit provides the core syntax rules needed to
begin marking up text in HTML, while the second gives you the skills you
need to start formatting text with CSS.  Throughout this unit, you
should attempt to incorporate new elements and techniques into your
ongoing “index.htm” site and/or your “mystylesheets.css” file.  Remember
to keep backups every step of the way!*

    and [“HTML
    Exercise”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXzmEdEgODo) (YouTube)  
      
     Instructions: These videos introduce HTML coding and will help
    orient you to the subsequent lessons dealing with specific elements
    and attributes used in HTML coding.  Note that these videos deal
    with some more advanced topics (like interactive forms); while
    learning these topics is easily within the reach of the self-taught
    student, they are beyond the scope of this course.  
      
     Watching these videos should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.1.1 HTML Comments** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ HyperText Markup Language: “Comments”**

    [“Comments”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_HyperText-Markup-Language-Comments_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Comments are a crucial part of well-written code. 
    They can document the function of different elements of a site,
    which can be invaluable as you are learning code and may be prone to
    forgetting what different parts of your file are for.  They also can
    be used to temporarily eliminate portions of your code that are not
    working correctly, which may be helpful as you troubleshoot
    problems.  Finally, in advanced coding, comments are used to
    communicate with other web technologies – you may not need to know
    this now, but if you find comments that look a lot like computer
    code elsewhere on the Web, it may prove useful.  Keep in mind
    however, that comments are delivered with the functioning code, so
    they are available to any curious user who looks at the source code
    for a website.

    Link: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ *Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML*: [“Hyperlinks”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_19.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Hyperlinks are the characteristic innovation of the
    Web that allows you to click on portions of a webpage in order to
    automatically navigate to another webpage, another part of your
    website, or even an anchor within the page you are currently
    using.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Using Hyperlinks”**
    Instructions: Using the information from the above reading, try to
    include a link to a URL on the Web in your “index.htm” file.  Then,
    try creating a second \*.htm file with different content than
    “index.htm” and link to that on your home computer.  Be sure to add
    comments describing the links you add.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.1.3 HTML Lists** <span id="2.1.3"></span>

    HTML/XHTML*: [“Lists”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_15.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: As you learned in subunit 1.3: Writing for the Web,
    users of the Internet tend to look for information very quickly and
    lists are a user-friendly way to make your information easy to
    find.  Additionally, lists are often used to organize the elements
    of a menu; since we will be returning to this special use of lists,
    don’t worry about it right now.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.  
      
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Using HTML Lists”**
    Instructions: Using the information in the previous reading and your
    pre-writing assignment, try to incorporate one or two types of
    informational lists into your example webpage.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.1.4 HTML Tables** <span id="2.1.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML: “Tables”**
    Link: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ *Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML*: [“Tables”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_16.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Tables are used on the Web in much the same way that
    they are used in word processing: to present tabular data.  This
    use-case is extremely helpful for users, as it makes information
    easy to locate and see.  In this chapter, Mobbs notes that tables
    can also be used to structure the elements of a webpage, since you
    can include images, paragraphs, and many other elements inside each
    cell.  Generally speaking, this is a use-case for tables that has
    been superseded by the use of CSS to position and organize content
    and should be avoided.  In conceptual terms, the reason for this is
    that using tables to organize content is effectively a use of HTML
    for presentational information – which is CSS’s job.  Instead,
    tables should be used for semantic information – that is, to
    designate a part of an HTML file as tabular data, rather than to
    specify how that data is presented.  That said, in some Content
    Management Systems, tables may be the only convenient way to
    organize content in an HTML file.  In these cases, using tables to
    organize content is fine.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: This chapter provides some additional syntax for
    tables that may be of use in situations where you must organize
    content using tables, rather than simply using them to present
    tabular data.  Again: this is not a recommended practice and has
    been superseded by the use of CSS to position and organize content,
    but is sometimes necessary when content management systems limit the
    abstraction of presentational from semantic content.

    HTML/XHTML*: [“Adding Comments to Your Style
    Sheet”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_39.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: The use of comments in CSS is very similar to the use
    of comments in HTML.  However, as you will soon see, CSS for even a
    simple webpage takes requires a trained eye.  As you develop that
    eye, it will be very useful for you to use comments liberally:
    consider commenting every rule in your style sheet, indicating what
    you intend the rule to do, so that if you have surprising results
    you can compare what you intended to your actual output and try to
    pinpoint where you went wrong.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Defining CSS Styles”**
    Instructions: Based on what you have just read, take a look at your
    “mystylesheets.css” file and see if you can identify the different
    parts of each style and guess their function.  Consider
    experimenting with these styles to see if you can change how your
    “index.htm” file appears in the Web browser – but remember to keep
    back-up copies of your files!  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.2.3 Formatting Text Using CSS** <span id="2.2.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ Cascading Style Sheets: “Fonts and Text” and

     Instructions: One typical use of CSS is formatting fonts and text
    when you present the content of an HTML file.  The “Fonts and Text”
    chapter introduces many of the core techniques for modifying the
    appearance of text, while the “Lengths and Units” chapter introduces
    the measuring systems used for changing the size and position of
    HTML elements.

    Instructions: Based on what you have just read, you should
    experiment with using several of these text-formatting techniques by
    modifying your “mystylesheets.css” file to produce different
    appearances for your “index.htm” file.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**2.2.4 Inline Styles, Embedded CSS, and Externally Linked CSS** <span
id="2.2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Wikiversity’s Web Design: “Inline CSS”, “Embedded CSS”,
    and “External CSS”**
    Link: Wikiversity’s *Web Design*: [“Inline
    CSS”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_Wikiversity_Web-Design-Inline-CSS_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF),

    CSS”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_Wikiversity_Web-Design-External-CSS_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: We have already learned in sub-subunit: 1.3.3
    Applying CSS to HTML that there are three different ways of applying
    styles to HTML.  While we have already created an example of
    “external” or “linked” CSS (which is generally the best practice for
    web coding), it is important for you to be able to distinguish
    between inline, embedded, and external use-cases of CSS.  This is
    particularly true if you are working with existing websites that may
    more than one of these techniques, or if you are using a content
    management system that prevents you from linking to external style
    sheets.  For the purposes of learning these different techniques,
    create a few copies of “index.htm” in different directories and try
    using the techniques you have learned in this unit to modify the
    presentation of your paragraphs and headings using each technique. 
    Also try using two or more of these techniques to modify the same
    version of your “index.htm” file – you will likely have unexpected
    results if your styles conflict.  Keep this in mind as you advance
    through the rest of this unit, as the reasons for this will become
    more clear as you come to understand the “cascading” nature of
    “cascading style sheets.”  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

**2.2.5 CSS Selectors** <span id="2.2.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ Cascading Style Sheets: “Selectors”**
    Link: WikiBooks’ *Cascading Style Sheets*:
    [“Selectors”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_Cascading-Style-Sheets-Selectors_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Selectors are the means through which a CSS file
    “selects” specific elements from an HTML file and then applies a
    specified style to those elements.  For example, if you want to
    apply a style to some, but not all paragraphs on your webpage, class
    selectors will allow you to do this; similarly, if you want to apply
    a style just one \<h2\> element on your webpage, id selectors will
    make this possible.  In this regard, selectors are the core
    technique that enables you to abstract presentational information
    into the CSS file while leaving semantic information in the HTML
    file.  NOTE: Since Internet Explorer 6 is extremely outdated at this
    point, you may choose to ignore the advice given in this chapter
    about incompatibilities with this browser; also don’t worry about
    discussion of XML or later versions of CSS that appear in this
    chapter, as these are not concepts you need to know to continue
    working with your example webpage.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

    article [here](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets/Selectors) (HTML).

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Using CSS Selectors”**
    Instructions: Spend some time looking at the CSS file you have
    already created and experimenting with selectors to modify the
    presentation of your HTML file.  Remember that id and class
    selectors will only work if you specify the ids or classes in your
    “index.htm” file – go ahead and experiment with this using the
    examples in this chapter.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: What does the “cascade” in “cascading style sheets”
    mean?  What happens if there is presentational markup in an HTML
    file and conflicting information in an external style sheet?  Though
    difficult, the concepts in this chapter are crucial for
    understanding how and when style rules are applied, especially when
    inline, embedded, and externally linked style rules are present in
    the same page or site.

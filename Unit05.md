**Unit 5: Coordinating HTML/CSS-Based Websites with Other Web
Technologies and Going Live with a New Website** <span id="5"></span> 
*While we have already learned all of the basics of HTML and CSS and we
are prepared to make sophisticated non-interactive sites, many familiar
functions on the Web require the cooperation of HTML and other web
technologies and techniques.  For example, many websites use Server Side
Includes, JavaScript, XML/XSLT, and/or PHP.  When looking at existing
code, references to, or snippets of, these non-HTML elements may be
confusing, so it is important to know what to look for.  Equally, when
developing sites with interactive elements, learning the fundamentals of
how HTML works with other web technologies will be essential.  
  
 Given this, we will briefly address the function of these technologies
with optional readings before wrapping up the course with a discussion
of code validation and the basic techniques for going live with a new
website.*

    Client-Server”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_A-Bit-History-of-Internet-Chapter-5-Client-Server.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This is a short introduction to the difference
    between clients (such as your home PC of laptop running a
    web-browser) and servers (such as the computer which will host your
    website).  Understanding the client-server relationship is important
    to understanding the relationship between HTML/CSS and other web
    technologies.  It is also crucial a crucial concept to understand as
    you move towards going live with your example website.

**5.1.4 XML/XSLT** <span id="5.1.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ XML – Managing Data Exchange: “Introduction to
    XML”**
    Link: WikiBooks’ *XML – Managing Data Exchange*: [“Introduction to
    XML”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks-XML-Managing-Data-Exchange-Introduction-to-XML_12.7.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: XML is a SGML-based language related to HTML;
    however, XML is in some ways more flexible but in other ways demands
    more attention to detail.  The differences between the languages
    have led to a sort of division of labor: HTML is used for delivering
    most core content on the Web, while XML is used for data-heavy
    applications that require customizable data structures.  Even so,
    using the style sheet language XSLT, XML files can be converted into
    HTML files on the server before delivering those HTML files to the
    client or web browser over the Internet.  This brief introduction
    will not teach you to code XML, but will hopefully help you identify
    cases in which XML is useful.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

**5.2 HTML Validation** <span id="5.2"></span> 
-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Site Validation and
    Compatibility Check”**
    Instructions: Try validating a few of the pages you have created in
    this course; also try downloading the HTML of a website that you go
    to frequent and try validating it.  Also remember to check the
    compatibility of your code by opening it in a variety of
    web-browsers – minimally, the current versions of Firefox, Chrome,
    Opera, and Internet Explorer on a Windows machine and Firefox,
    Chrome, Opera, and Safari on a Mac OS/X machine.  Ideally, you would
    also check your code’s compatibility on older browsers and on
    browsers on GNU/Linux, iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, and
    RIM/Blackberry platforms before going live with a high profile
    website.  For a personal website, this level of attention to detail
    may not be warranted, however.  Alternatively, there are a number of
    webtools that will test a site for cross-browser compatibility once
    the site is already live.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.

-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ HyperText Markup Language: “Validating HTML”**
    Link: WikiBooks’ *HyperText Markup Language*: [“Validating
    HTML”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_HyperText-Markup-Language-Validating-HTML_12.7.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Validating HTML is one important step to ensure that
    your webpage is constructed of valid and well-formed HTML.  This
    will give you some assurance that your page will work on many web
    browsers; however, the only way to be certain that your webpage is
    widely compatible is to test it on a variety of platforms and
    browsers.

     Instructions: Typically you register the domain name (e.g.
    www.example.foo) at the same time that you pay for web hosting.  It
    may be of some use to you to think about the important question of
    what to name your website – and the legal limits that may be set by
    existing websites with similar names.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Domain Name Brainstorm”**
    Instructions: Brainstorm a few possible domain names for your
    website.  Use Google to check to see if these domain names are
    available.  Remember that the best domain names are memorable,
    short, and do not require the user to remember idiosyncratic
    spellings or usages of valid punctuation marks like the
    underscore.   Also remember that you will want your domain to be
    unique – if your proposed domain name is www.examplewebsite.net and
    there are already websites named www.examplewebsite.com,
    www.theexamplewebsite.net, www.example\_website.foo, or other
    similar permutations, you should consider seeking an alternative
    name.  When you register your domain name for business or personal
    branding, consider registering all similar domain names to prevent
    brand dilution.  Once you’ve determined an available and acceptable
    domain name you would like to use, make sure that it makes sense for
    your website’s title.  You may need to change your title to reflect
    the available domain names.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.

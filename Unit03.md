**Unit 3: Using HTML and CSS for Colors, Special Characters, Images, and
Multimedia Content** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn syntax and establish guidelines for
creating visually interesting websites.  This unit is divided into five
subunits.  The first subunit addresses the use of color on the Web, and
demonstrates how to incorporate colored text, backgrounds, and apply
color to other website elements.  This subunit also discusses special
considerations that should affect color choice, but a full discussion of
this topic should be pursued in the course of studying graphic design
for the Web.  The second subunit addresses the use of special characters
like punctuation marks, accented letters, and special symbols on the
Web.  The third and fourth subunits discuss how to include images and
video in HTML documents, and the final unit discusses how to format
these media objects using CSS.*

    Web using HTML4 and HTML5.

**3.1.1 Some Different Approaches to Specifying Color in HTML and CSS**
<span id="3.1.1"></span>

    [“Color”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_Cascading-Style-Sheets-Color_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: You have already encountered several examples of
    specifying color using CSS and/or HTML and are probably wondering
    how to figure out color specification on your own.  This chapter
    discusses the different ways that color is specified on the Web,
    providing examples that you can adapt for experimentation with your
    own example webpage.  
      
     Reading this material should take approximately 15 minutes.

**3.1.2 Selecting Colors Wisely for Web Publishing** <span
id="3.1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: “Color Scheme Designer”**
    Link: [“Color Scheme
    Designer”](http://colorschemedesigner.com/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: While designing color schemes for maximum readability
    is a topic best addressed in a graphic design-focused course on web
    design, Color Scheme Designer is a tool than can help you develop
    interesting and pleasing color schemes.  The tool can export these
    color schemes for use in HTML and CSS or it can be configured to
    specify the colors in HTML Hex codes, RGB color space, or other
    formats, depending on the color-naming conventions you are following
    after reading about Color in CSS.  
      
     Exploring this website should take approximately 15 minutes.  
      
     Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use
    displayed on the webpage above.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Using CSS Selectors”**
    Instructions: Like many web tools, Color Scheme Designer’s
    usefulness will become apparent only if you experiment with the
    features built into its relatively simple design.  Try to produce a
    few different pleasing color combinations and then apply them to
    elements of your example website using multiple, differently named
    external style sheets.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: You have already begun formatting text using CSS, but
    you may have realized that some punctuation marks and special
    characters tend to create problems when they are included in your
    HTML file.  This chapter will provide you with the special codes you
    need to include these characters.

     Instructions: Images are such a core part of the Web experience
    that we can hardly imagine a webpage without at least some
    illustrative or decorative photographs or illustrations.  Including
    images inline in a website is very easy.  Read all four pages under
    the “Including Pictures” heading on the Introduction to HTML/XHTML
    website.

    include this image in your example website.  Then, see if you can
    make that image into a hyperlink to a website elsewhere on the Web –
    or to a separate example page that you are developing.  Don’t worry
    too much about formatting it now, as you will learn to format it
    using CSS later.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: This is an optional, supplementary reading that
    provides some extra information about images in websites.  If you
    have successfully included inline pictures in your example site, you
    are unlikely to need this reading, but if you are having problems,
    it may be of some use.

**3.4 Putting Video on the Web using HTML** <span id="3.4"></span> 
*Note: Including video in can be a very complex process and generally is
treated in more advanced classes that discuss technologies like Flash. 
Even so, it is often the case that a simple website needs embedded
video, so this course includes the following information to help you get
started on including this feature in your websites.  Fortunately, the
emerging HTML5 standard will make video significantly easier to manage. 
If you do not intend to include video content on your site, you may skip
this subunit.*

    information about encoding, decoding, and playing video on the Web. 
    It also includes a thorough discussion of including video in an HTML
    file using the newer HTML5 standard, including a discussion of
    compatibility issues.  Since HTML5 has not yet been adopted by the
    entire web community, older techniques are discussed below.

     Instructions: Goer’s *Pocket HTML Tutorial *provides a very clear
    explanation of some simple use cases for alignment and indentation
    using inline and embedded CSS.  Note that he uses the \<div\> tag,
    which we have not yet learned about.  Don’t worry: the techniques

     Instructions: Oftentimes, you will want to select where or what
    size on a page you want an element to display.  The CSS positioning
    properties allow you complete control over where elements appear. 
    Ultimately, we will use these properties to create sophisticated
    designs; for now, however, after experimenting with the interactive
    elements on these pages, try to use the CSS positioning properties
    to place images of different sizes in different places on your
    example webpage.  Make sure that you master the “float” properties
    so that you can wrap words around an image.

    limiting; in order to develop lists that match your graphic design
    specifications, you will usually need to use CSS to change how the

    unit, we will learn to use CSS to style special lists to create
    menus for multi-page websites.

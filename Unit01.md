**1.1 Introduction to Key Terminology: Behind-the-Scenes Web
Technologies for Web Authors** <span id="1.1"></span> 
*Note: Several behind-the-scenes technologies must cooperate to deliver
websites to users who type in a URL or click on a link.  While a
comprehensive understanding of these technologies is not necessary to
build, maintain, or transform a simple website, the fundamentals are
helpful as we move towards the skills of writing and editing HTML and
CSS.  In particular, correctly using terminology can help you
successfully ask for help, whether in online forums or from coworkers,
peers, mentors, or family members.  Moreover, a basic understanding of
these technologies may affect the decisions you make as you develop an
example website, especially with respect to selection of an HTML
standard, hosting your website, and coding for maximum browser
compatibility.     *

**1.1.1 Webpages, Websites, and Web Authoring** <span
id="1.1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ Authoring Webpages: “Introduction”**

     Instructions: This selection introduces fundamental key terms that
    many users of the Web will already understand.  The distinction
    between web authoring, programming, and web design are important
    when talking with more experienced collaborators, or when seeking
    help on web forums.  This selection concludes with questions and
    activities will help you think about what characteristics, features,
    or content elements you would like your practice website to
    demonstrate.  Keep a record of your responses to these questions and
    activities.  
      
     Reading this website and completing these exercises should take
    approximately 30 minutes.

**1.1.2 Understanding Web Hosting and Domain Names** <span
id="1.1.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: WikiBooks’ Internet Technologies: “The Web”, “Domain
    Names”, and “Web Hosting”**
    Link: WikiBooks’ *Internet Technologies*: [“The
    Web”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_Internet-Technologies-The-Web_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF), [“Domain
    Names”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_Internet-Technologies-Domain-names_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF),
    and [“Web
    Hosting”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/PRDV251_WikiBooks_Internet-Technologies-Web-hosting_12.5.12.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: This selection introduces more fundamental concepts
    that many users of the Web will already understand.  The first
    general chapter titled “The Web” includes a rather theoretical
    discussion of “Publishing Webpages” that may be skipped.  Also note
    that the chapter on the Domain Name System is quite technical and
    only the main idea needs to be understood.  The chapter on Web
    Hosting establishes a fundamental understanding of how we move from
    functioning HTML and CSS files on our home computers to a
    functioning site on the Web.  This topic will be addressed in more
    detail in the last unit, but a fundamental understanding of how
    these technologies work together to create the Web experience will
    be helpful background as you move through later lessons.  
      
     Reading these sections should take approximately 15 minutes.

**1.1.3 Understanding URLs** <span id="1.1.3"></span> 
-   **Reading: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML: “Uniform Resource Locator”**
    Link: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ *Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML*: [“Uniform Resource
    Locator”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_23.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Identifying URLs in existing HTML files will be an
    essential skill as you look at HTML source code.  Additionally,
    without a firm understanding of how the naming scheme for specifying
    files works on the Web, it will be impossible to link CSS files,
    images, or other external data to your HTML documents.

**1.1.4 Development Environments and Content Management Systems** <span
id="1.1.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: The Saylor Foundation’s “Development Environments and
    Content Management Systems for the Beginning HTML/CSS Student”**
    Link: The Saylor Foundation’s [“Development Environments and Content
    Management Systems for the Beginning HTML/CSS
    Student”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PRDV251-OC-1.1.4DevelopmentalEnvironments-FINAL.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: In the contemporary workplace, use of development
    environments like Dreamweaver has become commonplace.  While this
    software can make some complicated tasks easy, it is best to learn
    how to directly manipulate the underlying code, as some tasks cannot
    be easily achieved using the graphical interface, including many
    common debugging, site maintenance, and custom design tasks.  The
    use of Content Management Systems (CMS) with highly developed
    Graphic User Interfaces (GUI) tends to abstract the user away from
    code-level concerns; even so, knowing how to directly edit HTML and
    CSS is a crucial skill for the CMS user.  This video introduces both
    development environments and content management systems at a
    beginner’s level.  This unit is not a substitute for taking a class
    or following an online tutorial on the specific setup or software
    you will be using.  
      
     Read this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

**1.1.5 (X)HTML Variants in Widespread Use** <span id="1.1.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: Mark Pilgrim’s Dive Into HTML5: “A Quite Biased History
    of HTML5”**
    Link: Mark Pilgrim’s *Dive Into HTML5*: [“A Quite Biased History of
    HTML5”](http://diveintohtml5.info/past.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: At this moment, the Web is undergoing a significant
    transition from serving web documents using HTML4-based markup
    toward HTML5.  Mark Pilgrim’s book advocates for the use of cutting
    edge HTML5 technologies, and in this chapter he gives a brief
    history of how HTML4, XHTML, and HTML5 came into being from the
    standpoint of an insider.  For the purposes of this course, we will
    be primarily learning the HTML4 standard, but we will occasionally
    look at HTML5 alternatives.  Many of the features of HTML5 that
    distinguish it from HTML4 are useful for kinds of functionality that
    are outside of the scope of an Introduction to HTML and CSS; for
    further information, consider reading Pilgrim’s book after
    completing this course.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: In the past, different web browsers could not be
    relied on to display code in exactly the same ways.  While this
    problem is much less of an issue today, there are certain features
    available on some browsers that are not available on others. 
    Perhaps more importantly, different browsers have implemented the
    emerging HTML5 and CSS3 standards in different ways.  While a
    complete account of these different implementations is beyond the
    scope of an introductory course in HTML and CSS, learning the
    fundamentals of browser compatibility may save the beginner some
    frustration.  
      
     Reading this webpage should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: The introduction to this chapter refers to coding
    skills you will develop in coming units.  The important concepts to
    take away from this reading are the guidelines that writers for the
    Web must follow to successfully communicate to internet audiences.

**1.2.1 Pre-Writing for your Example Website** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Writing for the Web”**
    Instructions: Drawing on the guidelines for writing for the Web that
    you covered in subunit 1.2, use a plain-text editor to compose
    several paragraphs, headings, and lists that you would like to use
    in your example website.  As you develop this content, you will want
    to refer to the activities and questions you answered in sub-subunit
    1.1.1: Webpages, Websites, and Web Authoring.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.

**1.3 The Functions of HTML and CSS** <span id="1.3"></span> 
*Note: HTML and CSS are core technologies through which information
encoded in a way that can be understood by web browsers.  They have
distinct functions that should be respected for maximum portability,
clarity, and easiest maintenance.*

**1.3.1 What is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)?** <span
id="1.3.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML: “What is HTML?”**
    Link: Leicester University: Richard Mobbs’ *Introduction to
    HTML/XHTML*: [“What is
    HTML?”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_03.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This chapter describes the function of HTML as a
    means to deliver information over the Web.  In this introduction, no
    clear distinction is made between the semantic function of HTML and
    the presentational function of CSS.  You will be learning more about
    this in sub-subunit 1.3.2 What are Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)? 
    For now, just keep in mind that this is because some websites –
    especially those that are very old, or those managed by certain
    content management systems – rely on HTML to markup both semantic
    content (that is: what content means) and presentational content
    (that is: how specific content should be displayed).  In the
    best-practice coding that we will be practicing, we will abstract as
    much presentational information out of HTML files by putting them
    into external CSS files.

     Instructions: This chapter includes your first hands-on experience
    with HTML code.  You should make sure that you take time to
    copy-and-paste the example code into your editor, create your first
    HTML file (“index.htm”) in a directory that you can keep track of
    (for instance, a folder called “PRDV251” on your desktop or in your
    “Documents” folder), and try opening it with your browser.  To
    prepare yourself for learning about CSS in the next subunit, please
    note that this introduction does not distinguish between the
    semantic role of HTML and the presentational role of CSS.  
      
     Reading this material and completing the exercise should take

    provide a good reference as you create simple websites.  You will be
    using them in future units, so save them in an easily accessible
    location on your computer.  The video addresses the different uses
    of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing some background on how these
    technologies were developed to work together to create the
    contemporary web experience.  The most important concept introduced
    here is “graceful degradation” – that is, planned failure of
    different features or parts of a website.

     Instructions: This chapter describes the function of CSS as a means
    to deliver instructions for presenting HTML files.  Pay close
    attention to the comments about the benefits of abstracting
    presentational information into a CSS file while leaving the actual
    “content” in an HTML file.

-   **Web Media: “CSS Zen Garden”**
    Link: [“CSS Zen Garden”](http://csszengarden.com/) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This website demonstrates the difference between
    Presentational Markup and Semantic Markup.  Here, the “content” is
    semantically marked up in an HTML file that is consistent for all
    possible style sheets, but each style sheet specifies a dramatically
    different way of presenting this information.  Try a variety of
    different style sheets and begin to think about how you would like
    your example website to look, once you have developed the skills to
    manipulate its appearance.  As you develop your example website, you
    may want to return to this web resource to harvest ideas for your
    own design.  
      
     Reading this website should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: This chapter describes three different ways that CSS
    can be used with HTML.  Keep these questions in mind: Which of these
    methods abstracts presentational markup from content to the greatest
    degree?  Why is this an advantage?  Note that inline presentational
    markup is required by some content management systems, while others
    provide a place to edit linked cascading style sheets.  When given
    the option, it is always best to modify the presentation of an HTML
    file using external linked CSS.  For the purposes of the stand-alone
    site you will develop in conjunction with this course, you will use
    external style sheets.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Creating a CSS File”**
    Instructions: Create a file called “mystylesheets.css” in the
    directory with “index.htm” and copy-and-paste the declaration and
    style rules from this chapter.  This CSS file is not yet linked to
    your HTML file, so it will not change how your HTML file appears in
    the Web-browser.  That is the next step.  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 15 minutes.

    Sheet”](http://www.le.ac.uk/oerresources/bdra/html/page_38.htm) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: This chapter provides you with the information about
    how you tell a web browser to format an HTML file with a specific
    CSS file.  Without this, the browser will use default style sheets
    to display the HTML.

-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s “Linking a Style Sheet to an
    HTML File”**
    Instructions: Using the information in the above reading, you will
    need to link your “mystylesheets.css” to your “index.htm” example
    webpage.  First, copy-and-paste the “link” declaration from this
    chapter between the \<head\> and \</head\> tags of “index.htm”
    (WARNING: make sure that your link declaration is not nested inside
    the \<title\> and \</title\> tags of the example webpage you created
    in conjunction with “1.4.2 The Essential Anatomy of an HTML
    file.”).  After saving “index.htm,” take a look at your page using
    your web browser.  The new style rules in “mystylesheets.css” should
    change the appearance of your page.  NOTE: Don’t bother with the
    style settings provided as examples in this chapter, as your simple
    “index.htm” file does not need the styles here.  The styles already
    in your “mystylesheets.css” file should demonstrate how CSS can be
    used to modify your “index.htm” file.  That said, there is no harm
    in experimenting – just be sure you keep backup copies of your
    files!  
      
     Completing this activity should take approximately 30 minutes.
